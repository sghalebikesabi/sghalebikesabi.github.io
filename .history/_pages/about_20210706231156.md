As you might have noticed, you just found my personal website!

Nice to e-meet you. I am a 2nd year PhD student from Oxford, supervised by [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), my doctoral studies are generously funded by ESPRC and Novartis. In general, I am interested in robust and safe use of Machine Learning tools to Health Care data. This is why I am super lucky to be currently doing an internship at the Health Intelligence team of Microsoft Research Cambridge. Shoot me an email, if you are interested in a nice chat.

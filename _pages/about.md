Welcome to my personal website :D

Nice to e-meet you. I am a final year PhD student from Oxford, supervised by [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), my doctoral studies are generously funded by ESPRC and Novartis. And as of 2023, I am one of the lucky Microsoft Research PhD Fellows. 

In general, I am interested in robust and safe use of machine learning tools (interpretability, differential privacy, fairness, ...) to health care data. During my doctoral studies, I have interned with the Health Intelligence team at Microsoft Research Cambridge on robust representation learning, and in the Robust and Verified AI group at Google DeepMind.

I am a Communications Chair at NeurIPS 2022 and 2023, and was previously AISTATS 2022 Publications Chair. I am also involved in the organisation of the popular [I can't believe it's not better - workshop](http://icbinb.cc/).

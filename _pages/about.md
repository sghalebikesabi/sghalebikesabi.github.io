As you might have noticed, you just found my personal website!

Nice to e-meet you. I am a 3rd year PhD student from Oxford, supervised by [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), my doctoral studies are generously funded by ESPRC and Novartis. In general, I am interested in robust and safe use of Machine Learning tools to Health Care data. This is why I was super lucky to have interned at the Health Intelligence team of Microsoft Research Cambridge.

I recently got the honour to be the AISTATS 2022 Publications Chair. Please let me know if you have any questions.

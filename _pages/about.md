As you might have noticed, you just found my personal website!

Nice to e-meet you. I am a 3rd year PhD student from Oxford, supervised by [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), my doctoral studies are generously funded by ESPRC and Novartis. In general, I am interested in robust and safe use of machine learning tools (interpretability, differential privacy, fairness, ...) to health care data. Last year, I have interned with the Health Intelligence team at Microsoft Research Cambridge on robust representation learning. And currently, I am interning at DeepMind.

I recently got the honour to be the NeurIPS 2022 Communications Chair, and was previously AISTATS 2022 Publications Chair. I am also involved in the organisation of the popular [I can't believe it's not better - workshop](http://icbinb.cc/).

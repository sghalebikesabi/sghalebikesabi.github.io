Nice to e-meet you. As of 2024, I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in the Science and Strategic Initiatives Unit led by [Pushmeet Kohli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushmeet_Kohli). My current research itnerests revolve around language model inference and user privacy. 

Before I started at GDM, I was a PhD student in the [OxCSML](https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group at the University of Oxford. My [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:94a33e80-ae9c-4530-8019-ae5780da21a4/files/d5138jf42t) on tackling privacy and model misspecification within generative modelling was supervised by [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As part of the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io/), my doctoral studies were generously funded by ESPRC and Novartis. And as of 2023, I am one of the lucky Microsoft Research PhD Fellows. During my doctoral studies, I have interned with the Health Intelligence team at Microsoft Research Cambridge on robust representation learning, and in the Robust and Verified AI group at Google DeepMind.

I was a Communications Chair at NeurIPS 2022 and 2023, and was previously AISTATS 2022 Publications Chair. I was also involved in the organisation of the popular [I can't believe it's not better - workshop](http://icbinb.cc/) at NeurIPS 2022 and 2023.
